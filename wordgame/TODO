For future versions, possible enhancements include:
-Multidimensional support
-Multiple adjcency modes (None, Strong, Weak).
-Multithreaded valid word generation
-Other performance enhancements where feasible
-Letter frequencies, possibly configurable.
-Sort boardwords by length, to easily find the biggest
-Investigate using a set instead of a list for boardWords
-More memory efficient, without sacrificing (much) speed.

Note that these might all introduce subtle behaviour changes, and so will need to bump the version number.
