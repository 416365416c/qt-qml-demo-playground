For the first version, required features include:
-Bag Results
-Basic Letter frequencies
-Flesh out the readme a bit more.
For the next version, planned enhancements include:
-Multidimensional support
-Multiple adjcency modes (None, Strong, Weak).
-Multithreaded valid word generation
-Other performance enhancements where feasible
-Better, and possible configurable, letter frequencies.
-Sort boardwords by length, to easily find the biggest
-Investigate using a set instead of a list for boardWords
-More memory efficient, without sacrificing (much) speed.

Note that these might all introduce subtle behaviour changes, and so will need to bump the version number.
