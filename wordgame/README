Design Notes
---
Since there is no good solution provided for documenting QML modules just yet, the documentation for each property has
been placed by its declaration in the header files.

The header files (*.h) have been documented and kept simple so as to serve as an example of designing C++ code for use by QML.
The source files (*.cpp) have not. They do not have extensive documentation or any special attempt at making the code extra
readable. Since the source files are not part of the design, it is recommended that you not worry about them and instead
peruse the design as a black box (like you would have to if you were a QML-only developer), reading just the header files.

The design attempts to follow the general principles of the blog post on Qt labs http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2010/07/20/designing-code-for-qml-uis/
This includes:
-A focus on Properties over imperative logic, for example the 'searchString' property instead of explict setters,
-Use of QObjects to encapsulate various parts of the functionality, BoardLogic, WordList and Tile
-NOTIFY signals for all property changes.
-Unit testing before writing QML code.
